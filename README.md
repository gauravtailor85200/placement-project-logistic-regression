# Logistic Regression Placement Project

## Overview
This project focuses on building a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of placement for students based on various features such as academic performance, internships, communication skills, etc.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is [provide dataset name or source]. It consists of [mention the number of features and samples] and includes features such as [list the relevant features].

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `placement_logistic_regression.ipynb` to explore the dataset, train the logistic regression model, and make predictions.

## Files
- `placement_logistic_regression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code and documentation.
- `placement_dataset.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the logistic regression model.

## Results
Include a summary of the model's performance, evaluation metrics, and any insights gained from the analysis.

## Future Improvements
Discuss potential enhancements, such as feature engineering, parameter tuning, or trying different models for comparison.
